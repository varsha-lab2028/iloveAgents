# Contributing to iloveAgents

## ⚠️ Before You Submit a PR

**You MUST run this locally before opening a PR:**

```bash
npm run build
```

If it fails, fix the errors before submitting. PRs with failing builds will be automatically closed.

**Common mistake to avoid:**

Never do this:
```js
import agents from '../agents/registry'  // ❌ WRONG
```

Always do this instead:
```js
import { useAgents } from '../lib/useAgents'  // ✅ CORRECT
const { agents } = useAgents()
```

## The Easiest Way to Contribute — Add a New Agent

Adding a new agent is the fastest way to make an impact.
It takes about 5 minutes and you do not need to know much React at all.

### Step 1 — Fork and clone the repo

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub first, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/iloveAgents.git
cd iloveAgents
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Step 2 — Create a feature branch

Always create a new branch before making any changes.
Never work directly on `main`.

```bash
# For a new agent
git checkout -b agent/your-agent-name

# For a bug fix
git checkout -b fix/what-you-are-fixing

# For a UI change
git checkout -b ui/what-you-are-changing
```

Keep the branch name short and clear so I know what the PR is about before I even open it.

### Step 3 — Create your agent file

Each agent now lives in its own file inside `src/agents/definitions/`.
The registry picks it up automatically — no need to touch `registry.js` at all.

Create a new file:
src/agents/definitions/your-agent-name.js

### Step 4 — Add your agent config

Paste this template into your new file and fill in your details:

```js
const yourAgentName = {
  id: 'your-agent-id',           // lowercase, kebab-case, URL safe
  name: 'Your Agent Name',
  description: 'One line description of what this agent does.',
  category: 'Category',          // Productivity | Research | Marketing | Engineering | HR | Business | Education | Design | Product | Legal
  icon: 'IconName',              // Any icon from lucide.dev/icons
  provider: 'any',               // 'openai' | 'anthropic' | 'gemini' | 'any'
  defaultProvider: 'openai',     // Only needed if provider is 'any'
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  inputs: [
    {
      id: 'input_field',
      label: 'Field Label',
      type: 'textarea',          // text | textarea | code | select | multiselect
      placeholder: 'Hint text for the user...',
      required: true,
    },
  ],
  systemPrompt: `Write your system prompt here.
    Be specific about the output format you want.`,
  outputType: 'markdown',        // markdown | text | json
};

export default yourAgentName;
```

That is it. The registry automatically collects every file in `src/agents/definitions/` —
just drop your file in and your agent appears in the sidebar.

### Step 5 — Test it

Run the app and find your agent in the sidebar.
Test it with a real API key from at least one provider.
Make sure the output looks right and the inputs make sense.

### Step 6 — Open a PR

Push your branch and open a pull request.
Use the PR template that appears automatically — it is just a quick checklist.

That is it. I will review it as fast as I can. 🚀

## A Few Simple Rules

- **One agent, one job.** A focused agent is a useful agent. If it does five things, it probably does none of them well.
- **Write a clear system prompt.** Tell the AI exactly what format to return. Vague prompts give vague output.
- **Test before you submit.** Run it with a real API key. If it doesn't work for you, it won't work for others.
- **No API keys in the code.** Ever. For any reason.
- **Use existing categories.** If your agent doesn't fit any, propose a new one in the PR description.
- **Keep it clean.** React functional components, Tailwind CSS for styling, components in `src/components/`, pages in `src/pages/`.

## Not Sure What to Work On?

Browse issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/AditthyaSS/iloveAgents/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) to find something beginner friendly.

If you have an idea that is not in the issues yet, open a new one and describe what you want to build. I read every single one.

## A Note From the Maintainer

I built iloveAgents because I wanted a place where anyone could run powerful AI tools
without giving up their privacy or setting up a complicated backend.

When you contribute here, you are helping make that real for everyone who uses this project.

I review every PR personally. I will give you honest feedback, and if something needs
to be changed I will tell you exactly what and why. I am not here to gatekeep —
I am here to help good ideas ship.

Thank you for spending your time on this. It genuinely means a lot. 🙏
